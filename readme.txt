Pygame
1. First step is to install and create a blank window using pyGame.
2. Now we shud be able to create an player object in this window which will move up and down on keyboard inputs.
3. Now we have to enable object to fire in horizontal direction while moving up and down.


4. Create obstacles randomly which moves from right to left. First smaller obstacles which can be destroyed by a single fire. 
5. Then larger obstacles which requires multiple firing. (And the obstacle should change their dimmension/color)


6. Create objects having various attributes(name , colour, dimension, shape, number of collisions, Weightage) and move them from right to left.
